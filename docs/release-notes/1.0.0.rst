1.0.0 release notes
===================

1.0.0 introduces the following changes, many of which are
backwards-incompatible with 0.5.

* :class:`.VideoFeed` and :class:`.VideoSearch` have been renamed to
  :class:`.BaseFeed` and :class:`.BaseSearch`, respectively.
* :class:`.Video`, :class:`.BaseFeed`, and :class:`.BaseSearch` are 
  now found in :mod:`vidscraper.videos`. They can no longer be imported
  from :mod:`vidscraper` or :mod:`vidscraper.suites`.
* :class:`.BaseFeed` and :class:`.BaseSearch` now fully implement the
  python generator API.
* :class:`.BaseFeed` and :class:`.BaseSearch` now support fetching
  specific slices of videos instead of fetching a certain number of
  pages.
* :class:`VideoLoaders <.VideoLoader>` were introduced as a more
  generic way to represent getting data for a single video.
* :mod:`vidscraper.errors` was renamed to :mod:`vidscraper.exceptions`,
  and unused exceptions were removed. :exc:`.CantIdentifyUrl` was split
  into two exceptions (:exc:`.UnhandledVideo` and :exc:`.UnhandledFeed`)
  and :exc:`Error` is now :exc:`.VidscraperError`.
* :func:`vidscraper.handles_video_url` and
  :func:`vidscraper.handles_feed_url` were renamed to
  :func:`vidscraper.handles_video` and :func:`vidscraper.handles_feed`, respectively. They now accept the same parameters as
  :func:`vidscraper.auto_scrape` and :func:`vidscraper.auto_feed`.
* Multiple :class:`.VideoFile`\ s are now made available for
  :class:`.Video` instances, rather than having a single set of fields
  on the :class:`.Video` class.
* Removed :mod:`vidscraper.utils.http` since the single function there
  was unrelated to HTTP, was only used by a single suite, and was of
  questionable usefulness period.
* Added support for testing with tox.
* Added vidscraper-cmd for shell access to the api.
* Replaced video pickling support with simple video serialization.
* Started using `python-requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_ where possible.
* :func:`.auto_search` now returns a simple list of searches rather than
  a dictionary mapping suites to searches.
